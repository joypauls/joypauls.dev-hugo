## Decomposing a Signal

## The Fourier Series

Fourier summation equals the sum of each component x strength of each component

Show plot of components

Show plot of frequency vs amplitude

### What It Means

## The Fourier Transform

One of the most beautiful results in all of mathematics is the Fourier transform: a method to transform any complex-valued function into frequency space. Using this transform to analyze a signal is called Fourier analysis.
