## What is the Lena Image?

While I will not be republishing the image here, [Lena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) (pronounced _Lenna_) is not hard to find. Tutorials, blog posts, and papers on image processing and computer vision - Lena has been everywhere. It is a portrait of a woman looking over her shoulder at the camera wearing an extravogant hat that originally was published in Playboy magazine in 1972. The model in the image is named Lena Forsén. In 1973, engineers at USC cut out and scanned the image from a copy of the magazine and used it for their research. In the following years, use of Lena as a test image for research spread widely until it eventually became standard: one of the most frequently used images in image processing and related fields to test or demonstrate new techniques.

### Problem

### In Lena's Words

Lena has spoken about the phenomenan that started from her photo several times.

In an [interview with Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/finding-lena-the-patron-saint-of-jpegs/) from 2019, she also said "I’m really proud of that picture"

## Alternatives

The good news is that there is really no reason to use this image anymore. There are many other choices that are just as easily available. A researcher in <> even identified other commonly used test images that are close to Lena in feature space, like the humble "Peppers".
